### Avoid hanging on "A start job is running for Raise network interfaces (Xmins Xs / Xmins Xs)" in booting

```

[  OK  ] Started Wait until snapd is fully seeded.
[ ***  ] A start job is running for Raise network interfaces (2min 20s / 5min 1s)
```

After it,

```shell

```

```
     5min 2.242s networking.service
          3.436s apt-daily.service

```

```networking.service``` help us with configuring network such as DHCP, but it will failed when our LAN cable disconnected or wireless router cannot be access. *So, it tries again and again until finally some part of the OS gets the message.*

It's a lot of wasted time, isn't it?

#### You can fix your ip address instead of using DHCP

[Set a static IP and DNS servers](#set-a-static-ip-and-dns-servers).

#### You can shorten the length of timeout

```networking.service``` is the name of the service which *raises or downs the network interfaces configured in ```/etc/network/interfaces```*. ```Raise network interfaces``` is the ```Description``` of it. Let's type a command to show the ```Unit File``` of the service.

```shell
sudo systemctl cat networking.service
```

```ini
# /lib/systemd/system/networking.service
[Unit]
Description=Raise network interfaces
...

[Service]
Type=oneshot
...
TimeoutStartSec=5min
...
```

```TimeoutStartSec``` is the key. Modifying the ```Unit File``` of system services directly is risky, so we need help from ```systemctl```.

```shell
sudo systemctl edit networking.service
```

```

```/etc/systemd/system/networking.service.d/.#override.conf*``` is a new, empty file which generated by ```systemctl``` and stored in memory temporarily now. We can type some contents into it.

```ini
[Service]
TimeoutStartSec=xxx
```

"xxx": *Takes a unit-less value in seconds, or a time span value such as "5min 20s".*

> When parsing, systemd will accept the same time span syntax. Separating spaces may be omitted. The following time units are understood:    
>     
> ·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;usec, us    
> ·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;msec, ms    
> ·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;seconds, second, sec, s    
> ·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;minutes, minute, min, m    
> ·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hours, hour, hr, h    
> ·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;days, day, d    
> ·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;weeks, week, w    
> ·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;months, month, M (defined as 30.44 days)    
> ·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;years, year, y (define as 365.25 days)    
>     
> If no time unit is specified, generally seconds are assumed, but some exceptions exist and are marked as such. In a few cases "ns", "nsec" is accepted too, where the granularity of the time span allows for this.    
>     
> Examples for valid time span specifications:

> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;300ms20s 5day
>     
> *From: Ubuntu Manpage: systemd.time - Time and date specifications | 16.04*

Here are some examples,

```ini
[Service]
TimeoutStartSec=1001sec
```

```ini
[Service]
TimeoutStartSec=21min 57sec
```

```ini
[Service]
TimeoutStartSec=1year 2months 3weeks 4days 5hours 6minutes 7seconds 8msec 9usec
```

**DO NOT** set a value that is too large even though it will be ignored.

And, type ```Ctrl-X``` to exit, type ```y``` and ```Enter``` to save file. Then, reboot your system.

<br/>

#### (Dumb idea)You can let your network interface start as "hotplug" mode

```shell
sudo vi /etc/network/interfaces
```

```
# This file describes the network interfaces available in your system
# and how to activate then. For more information, see interfaces(5).

source /etc/network/interfaces.d/*

# The loopback network interface
auto lo
iface lo inet loopback

# The primary network interface
auto enp2s0
iface enp2s0 inet dhcp
```

Now, ```enp2s0``` is using ```auto```, we should relpace it with ```allow-hotplug```,

```
# The primary network interface
allow-hotplug enp2s0
iface enp2s0 inet dhcp
```

At last, reboot your system.

<br/>

PS:

```allow-hotplug``` mode means:

- System only detect whether the interface is available at boot time
- After restart ```networking.service```, those "hotplug" interfaces will not be activated again and be assigned IP address automatically

So,

```shell
sudo ifup enp2s0
```

No information will be returned when everything goes correct. If DHCP has been set(e.g. ```iface enp2s0 inet dhcp```),
