## Whatever

### screen - The wave that never dies

Create a session.

```shell
screen screenname
```

Leave from here.

```shell
screen -d
```

Where I've been?

```shell
screen -ls
```

I want to go there again.

```shell
screen -r balabala
```

~"There is no screen to be resumed"?~

```shell
screen -d -r balabala
```
