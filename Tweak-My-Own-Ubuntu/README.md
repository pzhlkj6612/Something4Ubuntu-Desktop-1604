# Tweak My Own Ubuntu - 16.04 Only

## Whatever

### Things that we have to do first

```shell
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
sudo reboot
sudo apt install -y vim
```

<br/>

### "Could not get lock /var/lib/apt/lists/lock - open"

```
Reading package lists... Done
E: Could not get lock /var/lib/apt/lists/lock - open (11: Resource temporarily unavailable)

### Avoid hanging on "A start job is running for Raise network interfaces (Xmins Xs / Xmins Xs)" in booting

```
...
         Starting Wait until snapd is fully seeded...
[  OK  ] Started Wait until snapd is fully seeded.
[ ***  ] A start job is running for Raise network interfaces (2min 20s / 5min 1s)
```

After it,

```shell
systemd-analyze blame
```

```
     5min 2.242s networking.service
          3.436s apt-daily.service
           592ms dev-sda1.device
           442ms plymouth-quit-wait.service
           389ms libvirt-guests.service
             ... ...
```

```networking.service``` help us with configuring network such as DHCP, but it will failed when our LAN cable disconnected or wireless router cannot be access. *So, it tries again and again until finally some part of the OS gets the message.*

It's a lot of wasted time, isn't it?

1. You can [fix your ip address](#set-a-static-ip-and-dns-servers) instead of using DHCP

2. You can let your network interface ...

...

3. You can shorten the length of timeout

```networking.service``` is the name of the service which *raises or downs the network interfaces configured in ```/etc/network/interfaces```*. ```Raise network interfaces``` is the ```Description``` of it. Let's type a command to show the ```Unit File``` of the service.

```shell
sudo systemctl cat networking.service
```

```ini
# /lib/systemd/system/networking.service
[Unit]
Description=Raise network interfaces
...

[Service]
Type=oneshot
...
TimeoutStartSec=5min
...
```

```TimeoutStartSec``` is the key. Modifying the ```Unit File``` of system services directly is risky, so we need help from ```systemctl```.

```shell
sudo systemctl edit networking.service
```

```
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  GNU nano 2.5.3            File: /etc/systemd/system/networking.service.d/.#override.conf00000000FFFFFFFF

```/etc/systemd/system/networking.service.d/.#override.conf*``` is a new, empty file which generated by ```systemctl``` and stored in memory temporarily now. We can type some content into it.

```ini
[Service]
TimeoutStartSec=xxx
```

"xxx": *Takes a unit-less value in seconds, or a time span value such as "5min 20s".*

> When parsing, systemd will accept the same time span syntax. Separating spaces may be omitted. The following time units are understood:    
>     
> ·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;usec, us    
> ·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;msec, ms    
> ·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;seconds, second, sec, s    
> ·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;minutes, minute, min, m    
> ·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hours, hour, hr, h    
> ·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;days, day, d    
> ·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;weeks, week, w    
> ·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;months, month, M (defined as 30.44 days)    
> ·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;years, year, y (define as 365.25 days)    
>     
> If no time unit is specified, generally seconds are assumed, but some exceptions exist and are marked as such. In a few cases "ns", "nsec" is accepted too, where the granularity of the time span allows for this.    
>     
> Examples for valid time span specifications:    
>     
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2 h    
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2hours    
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;48hr    
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1y 12month    
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;55s500ms    
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;300ms20s 5day
>     
> *From: Ubuntu Manpage: systemd.time - Time and date specifications | 16.04*

Here are some examples,

```ini
[Service]
TimeoutStartSec=1001sec
```

```ini
[Service]
TimeoutStartSec=21min 57sec
```

```ini
[Service]
TimeoutStartSec=1year 2months 3weeks 4days 5hours 6minutes 7seconds 8msec 9usec
```

**Do not set a value that is too large** even though it will be ignored.

And, type ```Ctrl-X``` to exit, type ```y``` and ```Enter``` to save file. Then, reboot your system.

### Set a static IP and DNS servers

*16.04 Only, IPv4 Only*

1. Which interface do I use for my static IP?

```shell
sudo ifconfig  -a
```

```
enp2s0    Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF
          inet addr:...
          ...

lo        Link encap:Local Loopback
          inet addr:127.0.0.1  Mask:255.0.0.0
          ...

...

```

```enp2s0``` is my choice.

2. Configure the network interface

```shell
sudo vi /etc/network/interfaces
```

```
# This file describes the network interfaces available in your system
# and how to activate then. For more information, see interfaces(5).

source /etc/network/interfaces.d/*

# The loopback network interface
auto lo
iface lo inet loopback

# The primary network interface
auto enp2s0
iface enp2s0 inet dhcp
```

Now, ```enp2s0``` is using **D**ynamic **H**ost **C**onfiguration **P**rotocol, we should make some modifications and additions,

```
...
# The primary network interface
auto enp2s0
iface enp2s0 inet static
address xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx(your ip)
netmask xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx
gateway xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx(gateway ip, usually the address of the router)
```

If you want to set the addresses of DNS servers,

```
...
# The primary network interface
auto enp2s0
iface enp2s0 inet static
address xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx
netmask xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx
gateway xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx
dns-nameservers xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx(first DNS servers ip)
dns-nameservers xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx(second DNS servers ip)
```

Here is an example,

```
...
# The primary network interface
auto enp2s0
iface enp2s0 inet static
address 192.168.1.100
netmask 255.255.255.0
gateway 192.168.1.1
dns-nameservers 8.8.4.4
dns-nameservers 8.8.8.8
```

PS: Do not place multiple addresses on a single line, especially ```dns-nameservers```.

3. Put your settings into effect without reboot system

```shell
sudo ip addr flush enp2s0 && sudo systemctl restart networking.service
sudo ifconfig  -a
cat /etc/resolv.conf
```

```
enp2s0    Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF
          inet addr:192.168.1.100  Bcast:192.168.1.255  Mask:255.255.255.0
          ...

```

```
# Dynamic resolv.conf(5) file for glibc resolver(3) generated by resolvconf(8)
#     DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE BY HAND -- YOUR CHANGES WILL BE OVERWRITTEN
nameserver 8.8.4.4
nameserver 8.8.8.8
```

### Get wireless network

1. Install ```wpasupplicant``` and ```wireless-tools```

```shell
sudo apt install -y wpasupplicant wireless-tools
```

2. Find your netword device

```shell
sudo iwconfig
```

```
wlp3s0    IEEE 802.11bgn  ESSID:off/any
          Mode:Managed  Access Point: Not-Associated   Tx-Power=20 dBm
          Retry short limit:7   RTS thr=2347 B   Fragment thr:off
          Encryption key:off
          Power Management:on

enp2s0    no wireless extensions.

lo        no wireless extensions.

```

```wlp3s0``` is my wlan interface.

3. Bring the interface up

```shell
sudo ifconfig wlp3s0 up
```

4. Scan the world

```shell
sudo iwlist wlp3s0 scan | less
```

```
wlp3s0    Scan completed :
          Cell 01 - Address: FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF
                    Channel:1

                    Quality=70/70  Signal level=-8 dBm
                    Encryption key:on
                    ESSID:"NB"
                    Bit Rates:1 Mb/s; 2 Mb/s; 5.5 Mb/s; 11 Mb/s; 9 Mb/s

                    Bit Rates:6 Mb/s; 12 Mb/s; 24 Mb/s; 48 Mb/s
                    Mode:Master
                    ...
          Cell 02 - Address: ...
          ...

```

```NB``` is the SSID of my router.

### Automatic mount hard drives at boot time

...

<br/>

Remember, It's **necessary** to use the following command to check your modified ```fstab```, unless you want to recover your system at next boot time.

```shell
sudo mount -a
```

No information will be returned when everything goes correct.

If ```<mount point>``` invalid,

```
mount: mount point /media/sdb1 does not exist
```

```<type>``` invalid,

```
mount: unknown filesystem type 'exr3'
```

```<file system>``` invalid,

```
mount: special device /dev/sdb1 does not exist
```

or,

```
mount: /home is not a block device
```

PS: ```<options>```, ```<dump>``` and ```<pass>``` will not be checked probably.
