## Things you should know first

#### Access the Grub Menu

> If your system is UEFI, [advice on the forums](https://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2345616#post13579808) says the **ESC key** might be used instead of **Shift** to display the grub menu.

> - If your install only sees one system, grub is not normally shown, it assumes you just want to boot default as that is only choice.    
> - If UEFI and booting in UEFI mode you press **escape key** (perhaps more than once) just after UEFI screen but before grub menu. If UEFI has fast boot on, you may not have time to press a key.    
> - If BIOS boot you press and hold **shift key** from BIOS until grub menu appears.
